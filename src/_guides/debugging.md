You can use [Chrome DevTools][] and the
[Dart development compiler (dartdevc)][dartdevc]
to debug your Dart web app.

This page focuses on setup and
special considerations for Dart. For general information on debugging with
Chrome DevTools, see the JavaScript debugging
[get started guide][JavaScript get started guide] and
[reference.][JavaScript debugging reference]

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note:**
A [Dart fork of Chrome DevTools][]
exists but isn't ready yet for general use. For the latest status, see the
[devtools-frontend README.][devtools-frontend README]

NOTE TO EDITORS:
Be careful to match the text formatting and terminology of the Chrome DevTools
docs (https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) â€” especially
the JavaScript debugging reference and JavaScript get started guide,
so readers can easily switch back and forth between these docs.

TODO:
Once Dart DevTools (or whatever we call it)
is ready for use by ordinary developers,
make DDT the first section/page and CDT the second,
with the DDT section having all the step-by-step directions.

## Getting started with Chrome DevTools {#using-chrome-devtools}

The Dart development compiler (dartdevc) has built-in support for source maps
and for custom formatting of Dart objects. Keep the following in mind when using
Chrome DevTools with dartdevc:

* To see Dart types, you must
  [enable custom formatters](#enabling-custom-formatters).

* You can't use Dart code in the console.
  Sometimes, however, the JavaScript code is very close to the Dart code.
  For example, to view the value of a Dart **items** property,
  you might enter **this.items**.

* If you have trouble setting a breakpoint in Dart code,
  you can disable source maps and set the breakpoint in the JavaScript code.
  Then re-enable source maps and continue execution.
  For more information, see
  [Disabling and re-enabling source maps](#enabling-and-disabling-source-maps).


### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To use the Chrome DevTools to debug with dartdevc, you need the following software:

* [Google Chrome.][Google Chrome]
* [Dart SDK][], version **2.0.0-dev.65.0** or higher.
* One of the following development environments:
  * Command-line: [webdev and (optionally) stagehand](#getting-webdev-and-stagehand)  <br>_or_
  * A [Dart IDE or editor][] that supports web development with Dart 2.
* A [Dart 2 compatible web app][] to debug.
  The following walkthrough shows how to create a suitable app.


### Walkthrough {#walkthrough}

This section leads you through the basics of
using Chrome DevTools to debug a web app.

1. Create an app named **test_app** that uses Stagehand's
   [web-angular template.][web-angular template]

   * If you're using the command line, here's how to create test_app
     using [Stagehand:][stagehand]

     ```terminal
> mkdir test_app
> cd test_app
> stagehand web-angular
> pub get
```

   * If you're using a Dart IDE or editor,
    create an **AngularDart web app** and name it **test_app**.
    You might see the description _A web app with material design components_.

1. Compile and serve the app with dartdevc,
   using either `webdev` at the command line or your IDE.

   ```terminal
   > webdev serve
   ```

   <aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
    **Note:**
    The first dartdevc compilation takes the longest,
    because the entire app must be compiled.
    After that, refreshes are much faster.
   </aside>

1. Open the app in a Chrome browser window. For example,
   if you use `webdev serve` with no arguments, open localhost:8080.

1. Open DevTools: Press **Command+Option+I** (Mac) or **Control+Shift+I**
   (Windows, Linux).

1. [Enable custom formatters](#enabling-custom-formatters),
   so that you can see Dart types in Chrome DevTools.
   {% comment %}
   [**Using Dart DevTools?** You can skip this step,
   since custom formatters are enabled by default.]
   {% endcomment %}

1. Select the **Sources** tab.

1. In the File Navigator pane, select **Page** and navigate to
   **packages/test_app/src/todo_list/todo_list_component.dart**.
   You should see the component's
   [source code.][todo_list_component.dart]

1. Set a breakpoint by clicking line **41**, at the top of the **add()** method.
   [PENDING: In the next stagehand release, this will be line **36**.]

1. In the app's UI, type something into the text field and press **Enter**.
   Execution stops at the breakpoint.

1. In the Code Editor pane, mouse over the properties. 
   You can see their Dart runtime types and values.
   For example, in the `add()` method,
   **items** is a `List<String>` with a length of 0.

   <aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
   **Troubleshooting:**
   If you see `Array(0)` for items, instead of `List<String>`,
   then custom formatters aren't on. Enable them as described in
   [Enabling custom formatters](#enabling-custom-formatters).
   </aside>

1. Look at the **Call Stack** and **Scope** panes,
   which are in the **JavaScript Debugging** pane.

1. Resume script execution, and then enter something else into the text field.
   Execution pauses again.

1. If the console isn't visible, press **Esc**.

1. In the console, try viewing the **items** object:

   * Enter **items**.
     It doesn't work because JavaScript requires a **this.** prefix.

   * Enter **this.items**.
     This works because the JavaScript object has the same name as
     the Dart object.
     Thanks to custom formatters, you can see the Dart type and value.

   * Enter **this.items[0]**.
     This works because Dart lists map to JavaScript arrays.

   * Enter **this.items.first**.
     This doesn't work, because unlike the [Dart List class,][List]
     JavaScript arrays don't have a `first` property.

{% comment %}
Dart DevTools: 
items.first
items.isEmpty
items.length
items.runtimeType
[PENDING: once indexing works in DDT, tell them to try items[0])
{% endcomment %}

1. Try other DevTools features, which you can find in the
   [JavaScript debugging reference][] for Chrome DevTools.


## Changing DevTools settings

This section covers settings that you might need to change
as you debug your app.


### Enabling custom formatters {#enabling-custom-formatters}

To see Dart types in Chrome DevTools, you need to enable custom formatters.

1. From the DevTools **Customize and control DevTools** [PENDING: image of 3 vertical dots] menu,
choose **Settings**. Or press **F1**.
1. Select **Enable custom formatters**, which is under
the **Console** heading in the **Preferences** settings.
1. Close Settings: Press **Esc** or click the x at the upper right.

The best description I found was http://www.mattzeunert.com/2016/02/19/custom-chrome-devtools-object-formatters.html.
{% endcomment %}


### Disabling and re-enabling source maps {#enabling-and-disabling-source-maps}

Chrome DevTools <!-- and Dart DevTools --> enables source maps, by default.
You might want to temporarily disable source maps so that you can see
the generated JavaScript code.

1. From the DevTools **Customize and control DevTools**
[PENDING: image of 3 vertical dots] menu, choose **Settings**. Or press F1.
1. Find the **Enable JavaScript source maps** checkbox,
which is under the **Sources** heading in the **Preferences** settings.
   - To display _only JavaScript_ code,
   _clear_ **Enable JavaScript source maps**.
   - To display _Dart_ code (when available),
     _select_ **Enable JavaScript source maps**.
1. Close Settings: Press **Esc** or click the x at the upper right.


## Getting webdev and stagehand {#getting-webdev-and-stagehand}

If you're using the command line instead of an IDE or Dart-enabled editor,
then you need the [webdev tool][webdev].
To use the command line to create apps from standard templates,
you also need the [stagehand tool.][stagehand]
Use pub to get these tools:

```terminal
> # Get webdev & stagehand.
> pub global activate webdev
> pub global activate stagehand
```

If your PATH environment variable is set up correctly,
you can now use these tools at the command line:

```terminal
> webdev --help
```

For information on using `pub global`, including setting PATH, see the
[`pub global` documentation.][pub global documentation]

If you subsequently have problems running these tools
or you just want to update them, activate them again:

```terminal
> # Update webdev & stagehand.
> pub global activate webdev
> pub global activate stagehand
```
